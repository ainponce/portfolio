In this short piece, I want to share how I started on this path of hard work and creation. I'm writing this from a place of deep appreciation, and I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it.

I don't come from a wealthy or politically connected family. Most of my relatives have always worked as employees, following orders to put food on the table and maintain a false sense of stability. That mindset never sat right with me. Whether it's innate or learned, I've always had a tendency to question authority.

That same temperament often landed me in turbulent situations that I probably could have avoided. Between my age, lack of experience, and a hunger to "take on the world," I didn't know how to pick my battles so I fought them all. That approach brought me to where I am today. I may not be in the perfect spot, but I'm certainly not in a bad one, and I'm proud to have kept my identity intact.

Being independent doesn't mean I can't be a team player or follow a leader. On the contrary, I thrive in team dynamics where open dialogue invites reflection and mutual learning. Whether with peers or former bosses, I believe that when we leave our egos at the door, we all have something to learn.

In 2025, I decided to use social media, specifically X, to connect with the Argentine tech community. To my surprise, the builder, startup, and tech ecosystem is massive, filled with incredible people and projects. Connecting with them was one of the best decisions of my life (right up there with starting BJJ). Soaking up other people's experiences has helped me grow immensely, and I hope they've learned something from me, too.

I participated in many hackathons, and to no one's surprise, I didn't win or even place in any of them. But failure never discouraged me, it fueled my drive to improve personally and professionally. It felt like doors would shut just as I approached them, but I didn't mind. I just ended up forcing them open.

The future looks promising. Big things are coming, and I'll be as ready as I can be. I hope this gives you a better sense of who I am. Writing this certainly helped me realize exactly where I stand and where I'm headed.

*News soon.*
